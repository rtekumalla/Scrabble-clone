# Scrabble-clone

Detailed Description: 

Design and implement a digital version of the popular board game "Scrabble." The game challenges players to create words using letter tiles on a game board, each tile having a specific point value.


TO DO: 

1.  Game Board Setup:  Create the Scrabble game board consisting of a grid with premium squares
that offer bonus points (e.g., double/triple letter or word score). The board should be displayed in the
console.

2.  Tile Distribution:  Implement the distribution of letter tiles and their associated point values. The
distribution should match the standard rules of Scrabble, including the quantities of each letter.

3.  Player Turns:  Allow two players to take turns entering words on the board. Implement input validation to ensure players only enter valid words.

4.  Scoring System:  Implement the scoring system of Scrabble where each word's score is calculated
based on the point values of the letters used and any premium squares that the word covers.

5.  Dictionary Integration:  Integrate a Dictionary to validate whether a word entered by a player is
valid. Disallow words that are not present in the dictionary.

6.  Rack Management:  Each player should have a tile rack from which they can select tiles to form
words. Implement the ability to replenish the rack with new tiles after each turn.

7.  End of Game:  Define conditions for the game's end, such as when players have used all their tiles
or when a certain number of turns have been played. Declare the winner based on the total score.


 Format of Input/Output: 
- Players will input their adding a letter to the board one at a time. 
- The game will display the current state of the board, including placed tiles and scores, after each turn.
